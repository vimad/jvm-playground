# Ch01 - Introducing modern Java

## `HTTP2Check`

`HTTP2Check` should be run on Java 11 or higher. It may be run directly in a
command-line.

```
./HTTP2Check https://github.com/well-grounded-java/resources
```

## `Ch01` - `var`

`Ch01.java` should be run on Java 17 and requires classes from the `var`
directory. It is simplest to load and run this example in an IDE.

## `SwitchItUp` - `switch` expressions

`SwitchItUp.java` should be run on Java 17. As it has no dependencies on other
classes it may be compiled and run at the command-line. It is also easily
runnable when loaded in an IDE.

```
javac SwitchItUp.java
java SwitchItUp
```
